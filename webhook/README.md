## Setup

1. From Rookout, navigate to the Targets page from the menu in the top left.

2. Choose the Add new target button and select Custom Webhook as the target type.

3. Give the Webhook a name and input your Webhook URL which should accept HTTP POST messages and JSON payload data.  Save the target.

4. From within a Rookout breakpoint, configure the target to be your newly created Webhook target and invoke your application.
